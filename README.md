# Heelium Identity
Heelium Identity is a child theme of UNCâ€™s main WordPress theme Heelium. Based off a design wireframe from another agency, this child theme included a redesigned mega menu navigation and modified header, footer, and content areas. The theme was also optimized for mobile viewing and web accessibility. I handled development of the child theme with assistance from a colleague on CSS and styling.
